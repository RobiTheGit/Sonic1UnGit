# Sonic 1 UnGit Disassembly
This is a fork of the [Sonic 1 GitHub disassembly targeting _asm68k_](https://github.com/sonicretro/s1disasm/tree/asm68k) that aims to remove as much superfluous junk as possible. While the community disassembly is great for research purposes, it comes with a lot of stuff that makes the project folder unnecessarily bloated.

Furthermore, this project attempts to recreate some conveniences of the old Hivebrain 2005 disassembly â€” namely, undoing the extraction of every single object into its own file in the _\_incObj_ folder. Call me stubborn and old-fashioned, but I'd rather have everything right there in _sonic1.asm_ instead.

You may now go ahead and call me a heretic. I don't care.
